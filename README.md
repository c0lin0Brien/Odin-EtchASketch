This was the first of a series of projects I completed as I went through the Odin Project's online full-stack curriculum.
In this project, I developed my skills for working with Flexbox, javascript event listeners, and DOM manipulation.
The hardest part was definitely getting the grid to function properly, as I didn't have much experience with flex box beforehand and it was initially very overwhelming.
Overall this was a super satisfying project to complete, and I'm happy with the final product.
